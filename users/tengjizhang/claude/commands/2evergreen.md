# /2evergreen

Convert explored content into evergreen notes. Invoke `evergreen` skill for format/quality.

## Process by Input Type

**Conversation** → Identify topics with genuine engagement → present for selection → write

**Draft** → Critical review first (misconceptions, logical leaps) → filter to quality bar → write

**Annotated Source** → Annotations are signals; return to source → extract directly

## Writing

1. Identify dependencies between concepts
2. Write in dependency order
3. Refactor as you go (link don't repeat)

For conversations/drafts: discuss selection before creating notes.
