Transform our exploratory conversation into evergreen notes. Follow this process:

## Step 1: Topic Discovery

Identify the key topics I explored in the conversation where I showed genuine engagement through:
- Multiple exchanges and follow-up questions
- Conceptual connections across different parts
- Working to understand rather than just acknowledging

Present these as a numbered list with brief descriptions. Then ask me:
- Which topics I want to develop into evergreen notes
- If I want to reframe any topics
- If there are areas I want to explore more deeply first

## Step 2: Write Notes in Dependency Order

After I select topics:

1. **Identify dependencies** - which topics need others as foundation?

2. **Write notes in that order**, following project guidelines:
   - YAML frontmatter with relevant tags
   - Complete statement titles (Andy Matuschak style) unless it's an index note starting with `0`
   - Explain using your full expertise, scoped to what I actually explored
   - Natural inline wikilinks `[[Note Title]]` to connect ideas
   - Add sources for specific claims and data

3. **Refactor as you write**:
   - If re-explaining something from an earlier note → link instead
   - If a concept appears in multiple notes → extract to its own note
   - Trust the refactoring process - like code, write naturally then extract duplication

## Step 3: Final Review Together

After all notes written, review for:
- Missed refactoring opportunities
- Title accuracy (did emphasis match what we wrote?)
- Link completeness
- Tag consistency

## Important
- Don't create notes immediately - discuss topic selection first
- Focus on what I DID explore, not what I missed
- Each note self-contained but connected to knowledge graph
- Quality over quantity - fewer excellent notes beats many shallow ones

Start by analyzing the conversation and presenting the topics you've discovered.
