Process the following annotated source material into evergreen notes. The annotations are signals pointing to concepts worth extracting. Return to the source material for the actual substance, not just the annotation. Extract multiple atomic concepts from each annotation point. Elevate insights from specific context to general principles. Don't reference why I found something interesting in the final notes. Create separate evergreen notes for each distinct concept. Follow all evergreen processing guidelines from memory.
