# Evergreen Notes

Atomic, lasting insights for the knowledge graph.

## Format

- YAML frontmatter with 3-7 specific tags
- Title: complete statement (Andy Matuschak style), not topic labels
- Inline wikilinks `[[Note Title]]` - no separate "Related Notes" section
- Sources section with (Author, Year) for claims

## Quality Bar

**Include:** Genuinely grasped, non-obvious, atomic, lasting value
**Reject:** Surface observations, vague generalizations, obvious statements, current-event descriptions

## Core Principle

Only what was explored. The note reads "here's what you discovered, explained expertly."
- Track grasped vs merely mentioned
- If something would illuminate understanding → stop and discuss first
- Deepen, don't expand

## Multiple Notes

Write in dependency order. If re-explaining → link instead. If concept repeats → extract.
