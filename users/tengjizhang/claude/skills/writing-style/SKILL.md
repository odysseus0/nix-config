# Writing Style

Modular style system with composable principles.

## When to Apply

- Drafting documents, notes, articles, blog posts
- User explicitly requests "apply my writing style"
- Creating any written artifact meant for others to read

## How to Compose

1. **Always apply**: Core principles (references/core-principles.md)
2. **Context-dependent**: Add style modifiers based on audience and purpose

### Style Selection

| Context | Modifier | Use When |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Educational | Feynman | Teaching concepts, building intuition, beginners |
| Documentation | Pinker | Reference materials, technical specs, professionals |
| Personal | Minimal | Notes, reflections - core principles only |

## Application Process

1. Identify the writing context and audience
2. Load core principles (always)
3. Select appropriate style modifier
4. Apply during drafting, not as post-hoc editing layer
