# Style Modifiers

Context-dependent additions to core principles.

## Feynman Modifier (Educational)

For teaching, explaining, building intuition.

**Add these techniques:**

- **Start from familiar**: Begin with something the reader already understands
- **Build analogies**: Connect to everyday experiences when accurate and clarifying
- **Show reasoning process**: Walk through how you arrived at understanding, not just the result
- **Include the "why"**: Don't just explain what and how
- **Admit uncertainty**: Distinguish facts from models from speculation
- **Use enthusiasm**: Write with genuine interest, not artificial formality

**Best for:** Beginners, general audiences, anyone encountering concepts for the first time. When building intuition matters more than comprehensive coverage.

## Pinker Modifier (Documentation)

For reference materials, technical specs, professional communication.

**Add these techniques:**

- **Progressive disclosure**: Break complexity into digestible chunks, reveal gradually
- **Combat curse of knowledge**: Remember what your audience doesn't know
- **Information architecture**: Use headings as signposts, organize for reader's questions not your process
- **Precise terminology**: Define terms once, use consistently throughout
- **Appropriate qualification**: Use hedges for accuracy, not habit

**Best for:** Professionals consulting reference materials, intermediate audiences, interdisciplinary communication where precision is crucial.
