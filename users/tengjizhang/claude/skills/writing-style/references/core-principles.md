# Core Writing Principles

Always apply. The foundation for all writing.

## Omit Needless Words

Every word must earn its place. If removing it doesn't change meaning or reduce clarity, remove it.

- "the question as to whether" → "whether"
- "he is a man who" → "he"
- "in a hasty manner" → "hastily"

## Simplicity Matching

Match expression complexity to thought complexity. Don't add unnecessary complexity, don't oversimplify.

- Complex quantum mechanics → technical language justified
- Simple observation → don't wrap in academic prose

## Concrete Over Abstract

Choose specific, visualizable words over vague abstractions.

- "The system failed" → "The server returned a 500 error"
- "Improve performance" → "Reduce latency from 200ms to 50ms"

## Active Voice

Show who's doing what. Passive voice hides responsibility and adds words.

- "The experiment showed" not "It was shown by the experiment"
- "We decided" not "A decision was made"

## Plain Language Foundation

Use simple, clear language. Add technical terms only when they communicate more efficiently than everyday language.

## One Idea Per Paragraph

Each paragraph explores one clear thought. When you start a new idea, start a new paragraph.

## Answer First

State the main point directly before elaborating. Don't bury the lead.

## Break Rules When Needed

Any rule that produces awkward writing should be broken. These are guidelines, not laws.
