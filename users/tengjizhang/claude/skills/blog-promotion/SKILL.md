# Blog Promotion

Publishing is half the work. Posts need distribution to reach people.

**Core tension:** Be pragmatic about reach, but don't oversell. Connect with readers, not maximize clicks.

## Cover Image (X articles: 5:2 ratio)

1. Identify core concept/hook
2. Brainstorm visual directions (literal, abstract, metaphorical)
3. Generate prompt for AI image generator

**AI generators handle well:** Abstract/stylized, simple compositions, mood/atmosphere.
**Avoid:** Realistic devices, text on screens, detailed UI, multiple objects.

## Promotional Tweet

1. What's the hook? (problem solved, insight shared, story told)
2. Who cares? What resonates with them?
3. Draft as a person sharing something useful, not marketing

**Taste check:** Would this annoy you in your feed? Does it oversell? Is it genuine?

**Example (technical post):**
```
If you use Claude Code from your iPhone, you've probably hit two frustrations: scrolling is broken and auth randomly fails.

Dug into why — turns out both trace back to how SSH sessions work on macOS. Wrote up the fix and the underlying mechanics.

## Workflow

1. Read post, identify core value
2. Cover image if needed (brainstorm → prompt → iterate)
3. Draft tweet
4. `pbcopy` — ready to post
